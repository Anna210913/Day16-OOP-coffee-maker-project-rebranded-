# ☕ Day 16 – Coffee Machine in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

We have finally reached the **intermediate level of coding**!!   
This day was all about learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and rewriting the Coffee Machine project using this new approach.


## About the project:

In this lesson, we took the coffee machine from Day 15 and rebuilt it using **classes and objects** instead of simple functions and dictionaries.  
OOP helps us structure programs in a cleaner, more organized way modeling the real machines or systems in the real world.

Instead of having all logic in one file, everything is separated into different parts (classes) that each handle their own job.  
This makes the program easier to understand, maintain, and expand.

## What I Learned:

- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is and why we use it  
- How to create **classes and objects**
- Attributes vs. methods (variables vs. functions inside a class)
- How to build and initialize objects with `__init__()`
- How to call methods and access attributes using dot notation
- How to install and use **Python packages from PyPI**
- How to modify object attributes and call methods
- Re-building the coffee machine using multiple classes


## How did OOP Changed the Coffee Machine?:

| Without OOP (Day 15) | With OOP (Day 16) |
|---|---|
Everything in one script | Code is split into classes (CoffeeMaker, Menu, MoneyMachine, etc.) |
Used functions and dictionaries | Each class has **its own methods and data** |
Harder to scale or add features | Easy to add new features (like new drinks or a display panel) |
Resources & logic mixed together | Responsibilities separated — cleaner structure |
